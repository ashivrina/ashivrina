### Good afternoon, good evening, and good night! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ 

For those of you who don't know me (yet), my name is Anna.
I am happy to welcome you on my github page.

- ðŸ”­ I have been working in Quality Assurance for more than 7 years. 
- ðŸ¤– Now I am a QA Automation Engineer. 
- ðŸŒ± Also, I am thrilled with opportunities generative AI provides us with, so I am learning everything I can about this topic.

I also enjoy reading good books, cooking, teaching and learning English, travelling, and good long walks.
