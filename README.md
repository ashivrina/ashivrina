### Good afternoon, good evening, and good night! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ 

For those of you who don't know me (yet), my name is Anna.
I am happy to welcome you on my github page.

I have been working as a QA Engineer for more than 5 years, and currently I am very into QA automation and everything around it. 
Also, I am thrilled with opportunities generative AI provides us with, so I am learning everything I can about this topic.

I also enjoy reading good books, teaching and learning English, travelling, and good long walks.
